## P.S
- I tried to use latest version of docker image in the yaml. So
  - in 11-1_fluentd.yaml, you will see the version I use is `v1.16.2-1.0`.
  - in 11-2_nginx-fast-storage.yaml, the version I use is `stable-alpine3.17-slim`.
  - in 11-3_nginx-fast-storage-rolling-update.yaml, the version I use is `stable-alpine3.17-slim`.
