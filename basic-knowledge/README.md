# Source
- All YAML files are the sample codes in [Kubernetes: Up and Running, 3rd Edition](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/kubernetes-up-and/9781098110192/)

# Personal Notes
- All YAML files can be applied `kubectl apply -f xxxx` on GKE version _v1.21.5-gke.1802_.
- I'm not guaranted all of YAML files still can be applied further version because kubernestes evolves very fast.
